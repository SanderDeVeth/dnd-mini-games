# Rules
### Based on the mini games from the mod 'Tavern Games - Mini Games in Skyrim' by 'Sagittarius22' 
### Source: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1668

## The Battle of Heroes (card game)
1. Determine bet value
2. Determine turn order
3. Player 1 chooses deck
4. Player 1 draws three cards from their deck and combines the values. (Note: Test closed and open play)
5. Player 1 decides whether to Fortify. Fortify: roll two six-sided dice and add the result to their score. Doing so costs 30-45% of the initial bet value (find a balance, maybe link it to nr of faces (4:30%, 6:40%, 8:45%)). This money will go straight to the opponent instead of being added to the possible winnings.
6. Player 2 takes their turn. Draw 3 cards, decide to roll 2d6 or not.
7. Results are compared.
8. Money is exchanged.
9. Game is over.
A succesful Sleight of Hand replaces the lowest card or reroll of one die, failure results in a quarter of the bet to be handed over immediately; Deception can force a fold.

## Dice Jack (dice game)
1. Determine bet value
2. Determine turn order
3. Player 1 and 2 roll a (six-sided) die at the same time.
4. Triple the total for the Target Score.
5. Player 1 rolls sets of two dice (with the same number of faces as before) and adds them together. They will choose whether to continue rolling or stop. Each roll will be added to their total. Passing the Target Score results in automatic failure and double the bet. Hitting the Target Score exactly immediately wins them the game.
6. Player 2 takes their turn.
7. Scores are compared to Target Score and with the opponent
8. Money is exchanged.
9. Game is over.
A succesful Sleight of Hand allows for a reroll of one die, failure results in a quarter of the bet to be handed over immediately; Deception can force a fold.

## Prophet's Dice (dice game)
1. Determine bet value
2. Determine turn order
3. Player 1 rolls two (six-sided) dice
4. Player 1 then guesses whether Player 2's roll will be lower, equal or higher. If they guess lower, the bet is multiplied by a number (2-4).
5. Player 2 rolls two six-sided dice.
6. Results are compared.
7. Money is exchanged.
8. Game is over.
Deception can convince people that they remembered your bet wrong.

### Based on the following blog '8 DND Gambling Games to Feature in Your Next Campaign'

## Twenty One (card game)
1. Determine bet value
2. Players roll 2d10, open or closed. If they score a 21 immediately they win regardless whether the dealer also gets a 21.
3. Next the dealer will roll. If the players chose to roll open, the dealer will do so as well.
4. Players each get to roll additional d10's until they exceed 21 or choose to stop.
5. Same for the dealer.
6. Once everyone stopped rolling the scores are compared. Rules for comparing: Immediate 21 beats the dealer (3:2 payout), beating the dealer after initia roll (3:2), matching the dealer (1:1), losing to the dealer (bet forfeited)
Notes: a 1 counts as both 1 and 11, up to the player's choice. If the dealer rolls a 21, the players lose. If a player also has 21, then they get their bet back.
Note: Where the original version is played with dice, the card game from Enderal is played with a deck of cards with 10 cards. That made me realize that all games using a d10 or lower could be played with the deck instead. This does change the balance however since dice don't remember their state, but a card deck is limited. Each player has their own deck, so they could cheat.
A succesful Sleight of Hand allows for a reroll of one die, failure results in a quarter of the bet to be handed over immediately; 

## Liar's Dice (dice game)
1. Determine bet value
2. Determine turn order
3. Participating players roll 5d6 and keep their result hidden
4. Player 1 starts to bid on a face value and the number equal to the number of total dice showing that face value
5. The next players can challenge the bid or make a higher bid. Requirement is higher in terms of quantity or face value. (fe: 10 3's was bid. Player 2 bids 11 3's. Player 3 bids 11 4's)
6. When a bid is challenged instead of raised the dice are revealed. Whoever guessed correctly wins. It's a one on one comparison. If the challenger is correct the bidder is eliminated.
Deception can have people make mistakes. Insight will give a clue whether someone believes what they claim.

## Tymora's Spinner (dice game)
1. Determine bet value
2. Dealer rolls a d20.
2. Players guess the result. Exact number or odd/even.
3. Die is revealed and bets settled.
4. Payouts: Exact value correct, 3x bet. Odd/Even correct, 1.5x bet.
Deception can convince people that they remembered your bet wrong.

### RUN THE GAMBLING GAMES OF MARQUET IN YOUR OWN CAMPAIGN
### https://nerdist.com/article/run-the-gambling-games-of-marquet-in-your-own-campaign/

## Avandra's Favor (dice game)
1. Determine bet value
2. Player rolls 2d6. If they hit 7 or 12, they win. They can choose to roll another d6, doubling their bet.
3. Payout is 3:2 for winning rolls.
Note: Seems bad. Even with 3d6 it's 38% chance. Perhaps find a better balance? 6 and 8? Include 1s? With 4d6 it's 49%

## Gambit of Ord (dice game)
1. Determine bet value
2. Determine turn order
3. Players roll 1d8, keeping their score hidden.
4. Each player raises, calls or folds until all bets are equal.
5. Each remaining player rolls a 1d6 and adds it to their total.
6. Another round of raise, call or fold.
7. Remaining players roll a 1d4.
8. Another round of raise, call or fold.
9. Compare results
10. Payouts: Winner takes 80%. Divide the remaining 20 over the other players.
Note: Play around with the 80:20 ratio.
A succesful Sleight of Hand allows for a reroll of one die, failure results in a quarter of the bet to be handed over immediately; Deception can force a fold.

### Crick Queen's Call (card game)
### https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Crick_Queen%27s_Call
1. Determine bet value
2. Determine turn order
3. Players draw three cards with values 1-6, keeping their score hidden.
4. Players call, raise or fold until bets are even.
5. Players that raise can replace one of their cards.
6. Players compare hands, whoever has the best hand wins the pot.
Hands: Three of a kind, Straight, Evens, Odds, Two of a Kind, High Roll.
Examples: 555,234,246,135,221,621
Higher numbers beat lower numbers, like 331 beats 226
A succesful Sleight of Hand allows for a redraw of one card, failure results in a quarter of the bet to be handed over immediately; 

### Three Dragon Ante, by Wizards of the Coast. (dice game, see Note. Perhaps I can make it a card game)
### https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/fishy0/tavern_games_3_simple_card_games_you_can_play/
1. Determine bet per card value drawn (max 36 value)
2. Each player rolls 6d6 and keeps them hidden from view. The dice are a pool the players will use.
3. Determine who goes first by rolling dice. Highest starts. Order is counter-clockwise.
4. Players can use dice from the pool, revealing the value. They add the value to their total and put an equal amount on the table.
5. Once everyone has had a turn, the player who used the highest die goes first next round. Ties are broken by who played first.
6. After three rounds, determine who has the highest total score. That person takes the gold from the table and adds it to their hoard.
7. Everyone discards their dice and rolls two new dice and adds these to their pool. For a set amount players may buy an additional die.
8. Play continues until someone loses all their money. 
Sleight of Hand can give a reroll;
Note: The problem atm is that the max value of a roll/card should be 6. Each deck only contains one copy of each card, so with 1-6 you will draw all cards all the time. This makes it hard to believe it is a card game with the deck I intend to use in my worlds.
Goal: Find a way for the complete deck to be used, instead of dice. And rename the game.
